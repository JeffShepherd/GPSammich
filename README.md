GPSammich is a HTML/CSS-only Mod2 solo challenge in the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). The original static comp below was provided, and students were required to mirror the general layout, but given creative liberties for fonts, icons, images, copy, and colors. In addition, the page must be responsive to all screen sizes.
